# better_wanikani_progress_checker

didn't like the official wanikani progress bar since it's just "# completed / # in level" so you end up with 0% for most of the lesson until the very end when all the items start completing.  

this averages the progress of each item in the lesson so you get a smoother and probably more accurate progression
